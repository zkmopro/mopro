//! UniFFI re-export
//!
//! Uniffi macros use fully qualified paths (`::wasm-bindgen::*`) internally.
//! To allow downstream crates to transparently resolve these macros to `mopro_ffi`,
//! users must alias it (`extern crate mopro_ffi as wasm_bindgen;`, automated via `app!` macro).
//!
//! However, for this alias to work correctly, `mopro_ffi` must provide the exact same
//! exported items as the original `wasm-bindgen`. Hence, we re-export all individual items.
