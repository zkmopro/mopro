# Mopro example app

This is the example app of mopro. You can use the following commands to build native bindings for your iOS and/or Android app.

**ðŸ“š To learn more about mopro, visit: https://zkmopro.org**

## Getting Started

To set up and build bindings, follow these steps.

### 1. Install the Mopro CLI Tool

-   Get published CLI

```sh
cargo install mopro-cli
```

-   Or get the latest CLI on GitHub

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zkmopro/mopro
cd mopro/cli
cargo install --path .
```

### 2. Initialize adapter

Navigate to the Mopro example app directory and initialize setup by running:

```sh
mopro init
```

### 3. Generate Native Bindings

Build bindings for your project by executing:

```sh
mopro build
```

### 4. Create Platform-Specific Templates

To generate templates tailored to your target platform, use:

```sh
mopro create
```

### 5. Open the project

Follow the instructions to open the development tools

For iOS:

```sh
open ios/MoproApp.xcodeproj
```

For Android:

```sh
open android -a Android\ Studio
```

For Web:

```sh
cd web && yarn && yarn start
```

For React Native:
Follow the README in the `react-native` directory. Or [zkmopro/react-native-app/README.md](https://github.com/zkmopro/react-native-app/blob/main/README.md)

For Flutter:
Follow the README in the `flutter` directory. Or [zkmopro/flutter-app/README.md](https://github.com/zkmopro/flutter-app/blob/main/README.md)

### 6. Update bindings

After creating templates, you may still need to update the bindings.

Once you've run `mopro build`, be sure to run mopro update to refresh the bindings in each template. This command will automatically locate the corresponding bindings folders and update them accordingly.

```sh
mopro update
```

## Customize Bindings

### UniFFI

For mobile native apps (iOS and Android), you can use `#[uniffi::export]` to define custom functions that will be included in the generated bindings. For example:

```rust
#[uniffi::export]
fn mopro_hello_world() -> String {
    "Hello, World!".to_string()
}
```

After defining your custom functions, run the standard Mopro commands (`mopro build`, `mopro create`, or `mopro update`) to regenerate and update the bindings for each target platform.

### `wasm_bindgen`

For web (WASM) apps, you can use `#[wasm_bindgen]` in [`mopro-wasm-lib/src/lib.rs`](mopro-wasm-lib/src/lib.rs) to expose custom functions to JavaScript. For example:

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen(js_name = "moproWasmHelloWorld")]
pub fn mopro_wasm_hello_world() -> String {
    "Hello, World!".to_string()
}
```

After running `mopro build`, be sure to run `mopro update` to refresh the bindings in each template. This command automatically finds the appropriate bindings folders and updates them accordingly.

## Test

Run tests before building bindings

```sh
cargo test
```

Run wasm tests with `wasm-pack`

```sh
cd mopro-wasm-lib
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The `mopro-wasm-lib` crate is created during `mopro build` if youâ€™ve selected the `web` platform.

```sh
wasm-pack test --safari  # For Safari
# or
wasm-pack test --chrome  # For Chrome
# or
wasm-pack test --firefox # For Firefox
```
