# iOS Setup

Once you've completed the [Rust setup](docs/setup/rust-setup.md) you should be able to run `cargo run --bin ios`. This will create a new folder called `MoproiOSBindings`. Inside this folder there should be a file named `mopro.swift` and a folder named `MoproBindings.xcframework`.

First let's make a new iOS app Xcode project. If you already have an app project you can skip this step. We'll do File -> New -> Project and create a iOS App. Make sure the language is Swift. We suggest putting this iOS project inside the rust project folder created above.

Your Xcode project should be open now. Open Finder and drag the `MoproiOSBindings` folder into the project folder structure.

Next drag in any zkeys you plan to prove with. Go to the project "Build Phases" and add each zkey to the "Copy Bundle Resources" step.

Now you're ready to write the proving code in your app!

## Proving from the app

In your project there should be a file named `ContentView`. At the top of this file add the following:

```swift
import moproFFI
```

This will make the proving functions `generateCircomProof` and `verifyCircomProof` available in this module.

In the `ContentView` itself add a private variable and a button like this:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    private let zkeyPath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "multiplier2_final", ofType: "zkey")!

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Prove", action: runProveAction)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

We use the `Bundle` api to retrieve the full path to our zkey. Change `multiplier2_final` to the name of your zkey.

At the bottom of this file we'll add an extension with a function to generate a proof. In this example we're going to prove a simple circuit that accepts two inputs named `a` and `b` and generates an output `c`.

```swift
extension ContentView {
    func runProveAction() {
        // Prepare inputs
        //
        // The generateCircomProof function accepts an absolute path
        // to the zkey, and a map of strings to arrays of strings
        //
        // This is a mapping of input names to values. Note that if
        // the input is not an array, it will still be specified as
        // and array of length 1.
        var inputs = [String: [String]]()
        let a = 3 // First input
        let b = 5 // Second input
        inputs["a"] = [String(a)] // Numbers should be passed as strings
        inputs["b"] = [String(b)]
        
        // Begin timing our proof generation
        let start = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()
        
        // Call into the compiled static library
        do {
            let generateProofResult = try generateCircomProof(zkeyPath: zkeyPath, circuitInputs: inputs)
        } catch {
            print("Error generate a proof: \(error)")
        }
        
        let end = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()
        let timeTaken = end - start
        print("built proof in \(String(format: "%.3f", timeTaken))s")
    }
}
```

You should now be able to run the iOS app on the simulator or a device and build a proof. The app should log the time taken to generate the proof.
