# Getting started

This tutorial walks you through building a static library from scratch using the **Circom**, **Halo2**, or **Noir** adapter, and demonstrates how to integrate it with Android, iOS, and Web platforms. It also shows how to create example templates for mobile development.

If you already have an **existing Rust project** and want to generate bindings for a mobile native SDK or to build a mobile native app, check out the [Rust Setup](setup/rust-setup.md) guide for detailed instructions.

If you already have an **existing mobile frontend**, you only need to follow Steps [#0](#0-prerequisites) - [#3](#3-build-bindings) to generate the bindings, then proceed to the relevant integration guide below:

-   [iOS Setup](setup/ios-setup.md)
-   [Android Setup](setup/android-setup.md)
-   [React Native Setup](setup/react-native-setup.md)
-   [Flutter Setup](setup/flutter-setup.md)

## 0. Prerequisites

Make sure you've installed the [prerequisites](/docs/prerequisites).

## 1. Install CLI

-   Get published CLI

```sh
cargo install mopro-cli
```

:::note

-   Or get the latest CLI on GitHub

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zkmopro/mopro
cd mopro/cli
cargo install --path .
```

:::

You can run

```sh
mopro --help
```

to see a full list of commands and their usage details with, for example,

```sh
mopro init --help
```

## 2. Initialize adapters

Navigate to the folder where you want to build the app. Select the adapters using the `mopro` CLI.

```sh
mopro init
```

:::note
The following prompt will appear:

```sh
$ mopro init
✔ Project name · mopro-example-app
? Pick the adapters you want (multiple selection with space)
⬚ circom
⬚ halo2
⬚ noir
⬚ none of above
🚀 Project 'mopro-example-app' initialized successfully! 🎉
```

:::

Navigate to your project directory. (e.g. `cd mopro-example-app`)

```sh
cd mopro-example-app
```

## 3. Build bindings

Follow the steps below to build example circuits (e.g., Circom: `multiplier2`, Halo2: `fibonacci`, Noir: `multiplier2`). <br/> If you have your own circuit, skip ahead to

-   [5. Update Circuits](#5-update-circuits) to learn how to integrate it
-   or visit [Rust setup](setup/rust-setup.md) section to learn how to customize and expose functions.

Build bindings for specific targets (iOS, Android, Web).

```sh
mopro build
```

:::note
The following prompt will appear:

```sh
$ mopro build
? Build mode ›
  debug
> release
? Select platform(s) to build for (multiple selection with space) ›
⬚ ios
⬚ android
⬚ web
? Select ios architecture(s) to compile ›
⬚ aarch64-apple-ios
⬚ aarch64-apple-ios-sim
⬚ x86_64-apple-ios
? Select android architecture(s) to compile >
⬚ x86_64-linux-android
⬚ i686-linux-android
⬚ armv7-linux-androideabi
⬚ aarch64-linux-android
```

:::

:::info
See more details about the architectures in [Architectures](./architectures.md) Section
:::

:::warning
The process of building bindings may take a few minutes.
:::

:::info
Running your project in `release` mode significantly enhances performance compared to `debug` mode. This is because the Rust compiler applies optimizations that improve runtime speed and reduce binary size, making your application more efficient.

:::

## 4. Create templates

Create templates for developing your mobile app.

```sh
mopro create
```

:::note
The following prompt will appear:

```sh
$ mopro create
? Create template ›
  ios
  android
  web
  flutter
  react-native
```

Only one template can be selected at a time. To build for additional frameworks, run `mopro create` again.

:::

Follow the instructions to open the development tools

### For iOS

```sh
open ios/MoproApp.xcodeproj
```

### For Android

```sh
open android -a Android\ Studio
```

### For Web

```sh
cd web && yarn && yarn start
```

### For React Native

```sh
cd react-native && npm install
```

:::note
Setup the `ANDROID_HOME` environment for Android

```sh
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
```

:::

```sh
npm run ios # for iOS simulator
npm run ios:device # for iOS device
npm run android # for Android emulator/devices
```

:::info
See more details in [react-native-app](https://github.com/zkmopro/react-native-app)

## 5. Update circuits

### For Circom Circuits

-   Ensure `circom` feature is activated in `mopro-ffi`
-   Follow the [Circom documentation](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/compiling-circuits/) to generate the `.wasm` and `.zkey` files for your circuit.
-   Place the `.wasm` and `.zkey` files in the `test-vectors/circom` directory.
-   Generate the execution function using the [`rust_witness`](https://github.com/chancehudson/rust-witness) macro:
    ```rust
    rust_witness::witness!(circuitname);
    // ⚠️ The name should be the name of the wasm file all lowercase
    // ⚠️ with all special characters removed
    // ⚠️ Avoid using main as your circuit name, as it may cause conflicts during compilation and execution. Use a more descriptive and unique name instead.
    //
    // e.g.
    // multiplier2 -> multiplier2
    // keccak_256_256_main -> keccak256256main
    // aadhaar-verifier -> aadhaarverifier
    //
    ```
-   Bind the `.zkey` file to the witness generation function to enable proof generation. This ensures the circuit's proving key is correctly associated with its corresponding witness logic.
    Ensure that the witness function follows the naming convention `circuitname_witness`, as expected by the generated bindings and proof system:
    ```rust
    mopro_ffi::set_circom_circuits! {
        ("circuitname.zkey", mopro_ffi::witness::WitnessFn::RustWitness(circuitname_witness))
    }
    ```
-   Ensure the circuit input matches your circuit's expected format.
    Currently, only _a flat (one-dimensional) JSON string mapping_ (`String`) is supported.
    For example:
    ```rust
    "{
        \"a\": [\"3\"],
        \"b\": [\"5\"]
    }"
    ```

### For Halo2 Circuits

-   Ensure `halo2` feature is activated in `mopro-ffi`
-   Build a Halo2 Rust crate with the example: [plonkish-fibonacci-sample](https://github.com/sifnoc/plonkish-fibonacci-sample).<br/>
    Expose the crate with the following public functions:

    ```rust
    pub fn prove(
        srs_key_path: &str,
        proving_key_path: &str,
        input: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
    ) -> Result<GenerateProofResult, Box<dyn Error>>
    ```

    ```rust
    pub fn verify(
        srs_key_path: &str,
        verifying_key_path: &str,
        proof: Vec<u8>,
        public_inputs: Vec<u8>,
    ) -> Result<bool, Box<dyn Error>>
    ```

-   Prepare the SRS, proving key, and verifying key files. Place the `.bin` files in the `test-vectors/halo2` directory.
-   Bind the `prove` and `verify` functions with the corresponding proving and verifying keys.
    ```rust
    mopro_ffi::set_halo2_circuits! {
        ("circuitname_pk.bin", rust_crate_name::prove, "circuitname_vk.bin", rust_crate_name::verify)
    }
    ```
-   Ensure the circuit input matches your circuit's expected format.
    Currently, only _a flat (one-dimensional) JSON string mapping_ (`HashMap<String, Vec<String>>`) is supported.
    For example:
    ```json
    {
        "a": ["3"],
        "b": ["5"]
    }
    ```

### For Noir Circuits

-   Ensure `noir` feature is activated in `mopro-ffi`
-   Follow the [Noir documentation](http://noir-lang.org/docs/dev) to generate the `.json` and the [Downloading SRS](https://github.com/zkmopro/noir-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#downloading-srs-structured-reference-string) to generate the `.srs` file.
-   Place the `.json` and `.srs` files in the `test-vectors/noir` directory.
-   Ensure the circuit input matches your circuit's expected format.
    Currently, only _a flat (one-dimensional) string_ (`Vec<String>`) is supported.
    For example:
    ```json
    ["3", "5"]
    ```

## 6. Update bindings

If you make changes to `src/lib.rs`—such as updating circuits or adding functions with `#[uniffi::export]`—and want to update the generated bindings across all platforms, simply run:

```sh
mopro build
mopro update
```

This will automatically detect and update the corresponding bindings in each platform template you've set up.

## 7. What's next

-   **Update your ZK circuits** as needed. After making changes, be sure to run:

    ```sh
    mopro build
    mopro update
    ```

    This ensures the bindings are regenerated and reflect your latest updates.

-   **Build your mobile app frontend** according to your business logic and user flow.
-   **Expose additional Rust functionality:**
    If a function is missing in Swift, Kotlin, React Native, or Flutter, you can:

    -   Add the required Rust crate in `Cargo.toml`
    -   Annotate your function with `#[uniffi::export]` (See the [Rust setup](setup/rust-setup.md#-customize-the-bindings) guide for details).<br/>
        Once exported, the function will be available across all supported platforms.
        :::warning
        When using React Native or Flutter, don’t forget to update the module’s API definitions to ensure the framework can access the new Swift/Kotlin bindings.<br/>
        See more details in [react-native-app](https://github.com/zkmopro/react-native-app) or [flutter-app](https://github.com/zkmopro/flutter-app)
