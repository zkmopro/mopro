# mopro-sample-app

### WORKS FOR `IOS` ONLY NOW

This is a sample app. To compile it and the bindings for IOS, run the following:

```
cargo run --bin ios
```

You can then open the iOS project using:

```
open ios/mopro-test.xcodeproj
```

Then have a look at `ContentView` where there is a `circom` and `halo2` functions that shows how to use their functions.
